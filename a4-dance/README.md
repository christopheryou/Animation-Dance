CSci-4611 Assignment 4: So You Think Ants Can Dance


I followed all instruction as described in the write up and believe 
I have completed each and every step this time.  In doing so, I have 
properly created the transformations for each body part, I created an Ant 
that follows very closely to the ant described in the pictures at the top using
proper matrix transformations, and I have added motion clips that dances within moments 
of clicking each button.

There are no known bugs except occasionally, dance 4 will send the ant 
off screen due to how far forward he moves.  If you press dance 3, he will 
move backwards and end up generally where he started, though he appears to be offset from the floor (yes, my ant is a male, his name is Anton).
There are no standing bugs (except for my ants that are dancing because they are 
technically "Standing Bugs." haha).

As far as wizard work, I just closely followed the write up so I believe I have 
completed all steps.

Thanks!
